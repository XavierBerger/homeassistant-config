## Appdaemon applications

### Appdaemon testing

[Appdaemon-testing](https://github.com/nickw444/appdaemon-testing) is a framework designed to create unit test of appdaemon scripts. Even if the original version doesn't provides all the tools I need to fully test my scripts, I dicide to use it since it is easy to understand and easy to update.

The version procided into this repository is an improved version providing additionnal tests function.
