# Appdaemon application tests

***X@v*** : Can you explain me why tests are important in computer programming in 2 sentences?

***ChatGPT***: Tests are crucial in computer programming as they help ensure the correctness and reliability of code by systematically verifying that it produces the expected outcomes. They also aid in detecting and preventing bugs early in the development process, leading to more maintainable and higher quality software. Tests provide confidence in the stability and functionality of code changes, reducing the risk of introducing bugs when merging a pull request.

Voil√†, this is why I created this directory.

## Test coverage

Test coverage measures the extent to which a software's source code is exercised by a set of tests, indicating the proportion of code paths that have been tested.

For my Appdaemon application I try to cover the maximum of code with tests.

## Test framework

The test framework is a structured environment and set of tools that streamline the process of designing, executing, and managing tests, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of software testing endeavors.

I found on the Internet several test framework for Appdaemon. The one I choose was not the most powerfull but it is easy to understand and easy to upgrade.
